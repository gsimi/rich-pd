# r11265-M64 . 7-10-2013
# input from pulse generator triangle wave, rise time 1mus, fall time 3ns, 
#     amplitude 1.2V, amplitude measured withprobe 0.79V
# No termination 50Ohm resistance on the pcb since 
# termination is already present in the reistor chain
# signal measured on oscilloscope averagin a window of 7ns
# signal shape similar to pmt signal, but slightly shorter signal tfall=~50ns
#
# added pins on the pcb to guarantee a better contact
